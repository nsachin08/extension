# Factory Pattern

## Learning Goals
- Understand the Factory Pattern
- Learn how to encapsulate object creation logic
- Implement multiple concrete product types
- Apply a simple factory to return products based on input

## Instructions
Complete the TODOs in `exercise/FactoryExercise.java`.

When you think your implementation is correct, run the tests under `test/TestFactory.java`.

Passing all tests will unlock the next pattern: **Abstract Factory**.
